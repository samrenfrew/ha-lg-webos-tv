"""Constants for the LG WebOS TV (bscpylgtv) integration.

This module is owned by Cluster A and is the single shared constants
surface: every other module imports from here only (plan §4 ownership
rule). ``CONF_HOST``/``CONF_MAC`` are re-exported from
``homeassistant.const`` so downstream modules never import them directly.
