"""Coordinator for the LG WebOS TV (bscpylgtv) integration.

bscpylgtv pushes state over its websocket and invokes the registered
callback; the 10 s ``update_interval`` is a supervisory watchdog only —
it never polls a healthy connection. Each tick probes the link with a
real, timeout-bounded request (``is_connected()`` only reports connect
task liveness and can be fooled by a zombie socket) and, when the link
is dead, abandons the wedged client and connects a fresh one.

Teardown discipline (lgtv-ha connection.py): the library's teardown
re-shields its closeout task and swallows ``CancelledError`` until a
``ws.close()`` handshake a dead socket never completes, so
``await disconnect()`` on a suspect client is uncancellable. Such clients
are *abandoned* (best-effort ``connect_task.cancel()``, never awaited)
and replaced.
